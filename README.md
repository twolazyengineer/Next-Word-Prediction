## Introduction

The Next-Word-Prediction project aims to enhance text input efficiency by predicting the next word in a sequence. This is particularly useful in applications such as autocomplete, chatbots, and text editors. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases.

## Features

- **Word Prediction:** Predicts the next word based on the input text.
- **Customizable Models:** Supports various NLP models that can be fine-tuned or replaced.
- **Interactive Demo:** Includes a simple interactive interface for testing the predictions.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Comes with pre-trained models for quick setup and use.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Next-Word-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Next-Word-Prediction
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start using the next-word prediction model. Here's an example of how to use it in a Python script:

```python
from model import NextWordPredictor

# Initialize the predictor with a pre-trained model
predictor = NextWordPredictor(model_path='path/to/pretrained/model')

# Predict the next word
input_text = "I am going to the"
next_word = predictor.predict(input_text)
print(f"Next word prediction: {next_word}")
```

For an interactive demo, you can run the included script:
```bash
python demo.py
```

## Model Training

If you want to train the model on your own data, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your training data in a text file with each sentence on a new line.
2. Use the training script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path path/to/your/data.txt --output_model_path path/to/save/model
   ```

Refer to the training script's help message for more options:
```bash
python train.py --help
```
